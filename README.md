## [Calculator](https://bumboobee.github.io/area-cerimeter-calculator/) ‚¨õ - üèê - üî∫

The **[Calculator](https://bumboobee.github.io/area-cerimeter-calculator/)** is my first project with all focus in JavaScript **[functions()](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp)**.

At basics is a **area and perimeter calculator for rectangles, circles and triangles,** all of it in **just one page!!!** 
The user can input some values and **recive the result at the same time!** Amazing, isn't it? ü§ó

AAAh, I almost forget... theres a resposive layout too ‚ò∫

**For real, I love the process of making this project**
 
## About üì±

In this **[page](https://bumboobee.github.io/area-cerimeter-calculator/)**, you can calculate the areas and perimeters by just clicking in a button.

I used more CSS and JavaScript for this one... But the **[SweetAlert](https://sweetalert2.github.io/#download)** is on it too.

With some clean colors and a relaxing vibe, I created the layout and the pallet by my own, fell free to dowlaoad and make your own style ‚ò∫
